        <em>Atavistic gentleman scholar. Proud cat dad to the <a href="harlow.html" class="highlighter">late great Harlow</a>, and our current silly boy Jasper.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's my tiny bio over on Instagram. I've always had fun with my tiny bios on social media over the years. They've generally been mostly true. The question is: what do you want to convey of yourself? What might people care to know? Mostly I don't expect many people to ever read it and thus, my primary objective has been my own amusement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most crucially, I am BOOKISH if I am anything. I have always been a reader, and I am a collector, I have a decade's worth of experience being a dealer of rare and not-so-rare books, and I have illustrated a couple children's books. I have delved a little into bookbinding and even some very amateur font-making.
      </p><p>
        I also enjoy graphic design (when I am my own client), and a spot of illustrating, of which I'd love to work on my craft and do more of.
      </p><p>
        Bookishness and my interest in graphic design and illustration culminate in my main ongoing personal project: <a href="https://curiouser.house" class="highlighter">Curiouser House Publishing</a>.
      </p><p>
        Having been a bookdealer for a decade, one talent I am also able to apply to publishing is the <em>research</em>. I love researching old and odd books. To negate the need to deal with other people, I focus on works in the public domain: classics and obscure works worthy of resurrecting. This involves a degree of editorial considerations including what supplementary material I might be able to find and include. I design the covers and interiors and find illustrations and designs that are either in the public domain or are free for commercial use. There's more out there available than you might think.
      </p><p>
        All of this equals a very affordable if time-consuming hobby. A hobby that is incredibly rewarding... and one that I haven't had nearly as much time or energy to devote to as I'd like. The few dollars of royalty here and there are bonus. Maybe one day it could become a profitable endeavor...
